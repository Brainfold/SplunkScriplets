search factor  - The number of searchable copies of data that an indexer cluster maintains.
On a multisite indexer cluster, a special version of the search factor, known as the site search factor, determines not only the number of searchable copies that the entire cluster maintains but also the number of copies that each site maintains.

Replication Factor - 
In the case of an indexer cluster, the number of copies of data that the cluster maintains. A cluster can tolerate a failure of (replication factor - 1) peer nodes.
	On a multisite indexer cluster, a special version of the replication factor, known as the site replication factor, determines not only the number of copies that the entire cluster maintains but also the number of copies that each site maintains.
In the case of a search head cluster, the number of copies of each search artifact that the cluster maintains.
 
 search factor determines the number of searchable copies of each bucket. The default value for the search factor is 2, meaning that the cluster maintains two searchable copies of all data. The search factor must be less than or equal to the replication factor.
 ====================================
1. Restart the master node, as you would any instance. For example, run this CLI command on the master:  "splunk restart"
2. Once the master restarts, wait until all the peers re-register with the master, and the master dashboard indicates that all peers and indexes are searchable.
3. Restart the peers as a group, by running this CLI command on the master:
splunk rolling-restart cluster-peers

-- The rolling restart works like this: The master issues a restart message to approximately 10% (by default) of the peer nodes at a time. (If there are less than 10 peers in the cluster, it issues the restart to one peer at a time.) Once those peers restart and contact the master, the master then issues a restart message to another 10% of the peers, and so on, until all the peers have restarted. master restarts the peers in random order. In the case of multsite clusters, this operation is not site-aware.
=======================================
Restart a single peer
There are two ways that you can safely restart a single peer:
- Through Splunk Web (Settings>Server Controls).
- With the CLI command offline, followed by start.  (splunk offline ; splunk edit cluster-config -restart_timeout <seconds> # Extend restart period)
Do not use the CLI restart command to restart the peer, the master will not be aware that the peer is restarting
